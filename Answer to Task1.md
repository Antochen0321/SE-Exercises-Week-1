For protect myself from cyber crimes, I toke some differents kind of measures :

- Stop to use the same password everywhere

- Use secure password on important accounts (emails, banks account, inssurances...)

- Never register my bankcard information on my computer or on my phone

- Never open strange links for avoid fishing

- Activate de two autentifications system when it's possible

- Securise my email and checking every day for an alert

- don't donwload some weirds files for avoid malware

I got a troyan malware in april 2023, I tried to download a crack version of Matlab for studies but it failed and the malware acceded to my navigator files and toke all my registered passwords (Social Network accounts, emails...).
I think, since I toke measures I described in the first part, I will avoid this kind of attack, that experience learn me to be carefull with files that I want to download.
